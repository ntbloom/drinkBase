# drinkBase

a cocktail-finding app built using a react frontend with python/flask backend

### About

This project began nearly 3 years ago as a command-line only student project to
learn Python, and in the process developed into a fully functioning web app.

All cocktails are hosted in a cloud-based Postgresql database where recipes can
be queried by the individual ingredients they do or don't contain, as well as
the drink names themselves. This app is an efficient way to quickly find
high-quality cocktails based on what ingredients you may or may not have at your
disposal.

I've also tracked specific characteristics of varying ingredients (sugar
content, alcohol content, etc.) to provide dynamic calculation of drink strength
or sugar content. There is a d3 visualization to plot the sweetness and strength
of varying drinks but due to lack of time for physically measuring the sugar
content on all ingredients currently in the database, some of the sweetness
values are currently incorrect.

### Why

It is very hard to find good cocktail recipes on the internet, at least all in
one place. I wanted an independent website that was neither selling anything nor
writing 500 words about each cocktail with the recipe listed all the way at the
bottom.

I also wanted a tightly curated list of cocktails so that I could be certain
that any drink made from this list would live up to the standards of "a great
cocktail", whatever that means. In general I think it means not served out of a
slurpee machine, but it's an evolving definition.

### Want to know more?

Please reach out if you'd like to contribute recipes or code, or want to see the
live website. Otherwise feel free to clone the project and adapt it to your
specific needs.
