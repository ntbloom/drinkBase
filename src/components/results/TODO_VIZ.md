### TODO Lits for drinkViz

- onclick functionality? brings up recipe? maybe time for major UX decisions
- fix label pixelizations
- fix more/less alcohol bug
- pick color scheme for hot and double-shaken drinks
- other functionality? how to involve bitterness/acidity?
- get accurate data (and add NOT NULL to pgsql)
- responsive so it fits on all devices? make it desktop-only?
- zoom bar
