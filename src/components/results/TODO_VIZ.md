### TODO List for drinkViz

- onclick functionality? brings up recipe? maybe time for major UX decisions

- put color bullet point (or img of glass type) to left of recipes

- pick color scheme for hot and double-shaken drinks

- make recipes to left of drinkViz

- make shaker loader animation while drinkViz loads

- remove "(show recipe)" and onclick actual names for recipes

- sql queries for min/max axis values

- convert to d3.axis and d3.scale

- get accurate data (and add NOT NULL to pgsql)
  - buy refractometer

- responsive so it fits on all devices? make it desktop-only?

- zoom bar
