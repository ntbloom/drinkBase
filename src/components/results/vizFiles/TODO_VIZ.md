### TODO Lits for drinkViz

## Priority 1 - get full functionality:
- highlight recipes that show up in search
- name/ingredients on mouseover
- onclick functionality? brings up recipe? maybe time for major UX decisions

## Priority 2 - basic UX stuff:
- add dynamic sizing capabilities so it can be rendered smaller
- button for flipping on/off
- mobile version

## Priority 3 - finishing touches
- get accurate data (and add NOT NULL to pgsql)
- animations on-hover
